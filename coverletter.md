## Tell us what your idea is. 

Ask any parent - they will tell you how challenging it is to tell WHY IS THE BABY CRYING??? And how helpful it is if they can just tell what the baby needs promptly and take care of it, because HAPPY BABY, MORE SLEEP FOR PARENT, therefore HAPPY PARENT. 

From time to time, there are some celebrity nannies (ex: Tracy Hogg) that can tell what babies need by just listening to their cries through the phone. These nannies are so good that parents are willing to pay a lot for them to care for their babies. But not every parent can afford it… most parents still struggles every night trying to figure out what their baby needs, hoping to get a bit more sleep than previous nights.. Wouldn’t that be GREAT if they can quickly figure out what to do whenever their baby cries? 

LET’S DEVELOP THE BABY-SOUNDS-ANALYSIS TOOL FOR ALL PARENTS AND BABIES!!!

By collecting tons of “cry” samples of the “key signs” of babies’ discomforts would be a good start for machine learning. For example: cries of hungry babies (ex: babies not being fed over 3 or 4 hours), cries of babies who need diaper changes, cries of tired babies(ex: babies not sleeping for a few hours), etc. Once a good amount of samples are collected and the cries are analyzed, a tool “super nanny” would be what all parents need to get through every rough day and night before babies can talk! 



## Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 

We have several friends that became parents just recently. I would start collecting the samples with their (and their babies’) help. Once the samples are collected, the app can start “training” each “baby discomfort cry sound”. And once  the “beta” app is launched, the app will be tested by all parents around the world. It would be great if google can allow users to provide their babies cry samples while testing out the beta version, and  to tell us if the feedback they get is helpful or not (and if not then what it should be). The app will then have more samples and can keep training, therefore to make the “nanny” more accurate.

As of timeline, the plan would be:
By Jan 15, 2020, Collect as many cry samples from families and friends as we can.
By Feb 15, 2020, Use the cry samples to train the app to determine what cry sound could mean what, then give the beta app to families and friends to get their feedback and finetune the app.
By April 1st, 2020, Keep building the sample database, and release the fine-tuned beta version app to the public for testing and getting their feedback. With the users around the world, the app would be trained by more cry samples and able to distinguish the cries better.
By May 1, 2020, the app will become GA version and can be the Super Nanny (that would continue to train itself to assist parents better!)
